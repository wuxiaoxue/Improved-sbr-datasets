# Improved-SBR-datasets
=============================================
1. We improve the label correctness of five publicly available datasets for SBR (Security bug report) prediction by manually analyzing each bug report. We recall 749 SBRs, which are originally mislabeled as Non-SBRs (NSBRs).

2. We evaluate the impact of data label correctness on SBR prediction models. 
   (The scripts will be added while the paper is accepted.)
